"""# Strings and Regular Expressions

Strings are not like integers, floats, and booleans. A string is a **sequence**, which means it contains multiple values in a particular order.
In this chapter we'll see how to access the values that make up a string, and we'll use functions that process strings.

We'll also use regular expressions, which are a powerful tool for finding patterns in a string and performing operations like search and replace.

As an exercise, you'll have a chance to apply these tools to a word game called Wordle.

## A string is a sequence

A string is a sequence of characters. A **character** can be a letter (in almost any alphabet), a digit, a punctuation mark, or white space.

You can select a character from a string with the bracket operator.
This example statement selects character number 1 from `fruit` and
assigns it to `letter`:
"""

fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[1]

"""The expression in brackets is an **index**, so called because it *indicates* which character in the sequence to select.
But the result might not be what you expect.
"""

letter

"""The letter with index `1` is actually the second letter of the string.
An index is an offset from the beginning of the string, so the offset of the first letter is `0`.
"""

fruit[0]

"""You can think of `'b'` as the 0th letter of `'banana'` -- pronounced "zero-eth".

The index in brackets can be a variable.
"""

i = 1
fruit[i]

"""Or an expression that contains variables and operators."""

fruit[i+1]

"""But the value of the index has to be an integer -- otherwise you get a `TypeError`."""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%expect TypeError
# 
# fruit[1.5]

"""As we saw in Chapter 1, we can use the built-in function `len` to get the length of a string."""

n = len(fruit)
n

"""To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to write this:"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%expect IndexError
# 
# fruit[n]

"""But that causes an `IndexError` because there is no letter in `'banana'` with the index 6. Because we started counting at `0`, the six letters are numbered `0` to `5`. To get the last character, you have to subtract `1` from `n`:"""

fruit[n-1]

"""But there's an easier way.
To get the last letter in a string, you can use a negative index, which counts backward from the end.
"""

fruit[-1]

"""The index `-1` selects the last letter, `-2` selects the second to last, and so on.

## String slices

A segment of a string is called a **slice**.
Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character.
"""

fruit = 'banana'
fruit[0:3]

"""The operator `[n:m]` returns the part of the string from the `n`th
character to the `m`th character, including the first but excluding the second.
This behavior is counterintuitive, but it might help to imagine the indices pointing *between* the characters, as in this figure:
"""

from diagram import make_binding, Element, Value

binding = make_binding("fruit", ' b a n a n a ')
elements = [Element(Value(i), None) for i in range(7)]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from diagram import diagram, adjust
from matplotlib.transforms import Bbox

width, height, x, y = [1.35, 0.54, 0.23, 0.39]

ax = diagram(width, height)
bbox = binding.draw(ax, x, y)
bboxes = [bbox]

def draw_elts(x, y, elements):
    for elt in elements:
        bbox = elt.draw(ax, x, y, draw_value=False)
        bboxes.append(bbox)

        x1 = (bbox.xmin + bbox.xmax) / 2
        y1 = bbox.ymax + 0.02
        y2 = y1 + 0.14
        handle = plt.plot([x1, x1], [y1, y2], ':', lw=0.5, color='gray')
        x += 0.105

draw_elts(x + 0.48, y - 0.25, elements)
bbox = Bbox.union(bboxes)
# adjust(x, y, bbox)

"""For example, the slice `[3:6]` selects the letters `ana`, which means that `6` is legal as part of a slice, but not legal as an index.


If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning of the string.
"""

fruit[:3]

"""If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:"""

fruit[3:]

"""If the first index is greater than or equal to the second, the result is an **empty string**, represented by two quotation marks:"""

fruit[3:3]

"""An empty string contains no characters and has length 0.

Continuing this example, what do you think `fruit[:]` means? Try it and
see.
"""

fruit[:]

"""## Strings are immutable

It is tempting to use the `[]` operator on the left side of an
assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string, like this:
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
# %%expect TypeError
# 
# greeting = 'Hello, world!'
# greeting[0] = 'J'

"""The result is a `TypeError`.
In the error message, the "object" is the string and the "item" is the character
we tried to assign.
For now, an **object** is the same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition later.

The reason for this error is that strings are **immutable**, which means you can't change an existing string.
The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation of the original.
"""

new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]
new_greeting

"""This example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice of `greeting`.
It has no effect on the original string.
"""

greeting

"""## String comparison

The relational operators work on strings. To see if two strings are
equal, we can use the `==` operator.
"""

word = 'banana'

if word == 'banana':
    print('All right, banana.')

"""Other relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical
order:
"""

def compare_word(word):
    if word < 'banana':
        print(word, 'comes before banana.')
    elif word > 'banana':
        print(word, 'comes after banana.')
    else:
        print('All right, banana.')

compare_word('apple')

"""Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way
people do. All the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase
letters, so:
"""

compare_word('Pineapple')

"""To solve this problem, we can convert strings to a standard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the comparison.
Keep that in mind if you have to defend yourself against a man armed with a Pineapple.

## String methods

Strings provide methods that perform a variety of useful operations.
A method is similar to a function -- it takes arguments and returns a value -- but the syntax is different.
For example, the method `upper` takes a string and returns a new string with all uppercase letters.

Instead of the function syntax `upper(word)`, it uses the method syntax `word.upper()`.
"""

word = 'banana'
new_word = word.upper()
new_word

"""This use of the dot operator specifies the name of the method, `upper`, and the name of the string to apply the method to, `word`.
The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no arguments.

A method call is called an **invocation**; in this case, we would say that we are invoking `upper` on `word`.

## Writing files

String operators and methods are useful for reading and writing text files.
As an example, we'll work with the text of *Dracula*, a novel by Bram Stoker that is available from Project Gutenberg (<https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345>).

Before we process the text, we can remove this extra material by finding the special lines at the beginning and end that begin with `'***'`.

The following function takes a line and checks whether it is one of the special lines.
It uses the `startswith` method, which checks whether a string starts with a given sequence of characters.

A good debugging strategy is to start with just part of the file, get the program working, and then run it with the whole file.

To make a small file that contains part of a larger file, we can use `!head` again with the redirect operator, `>`, which indicates that the results should be written to a file rather than displayed.

"""This shell command reads the first 100 lines from `pg345_cleaned.txt` and writes them to a file called `pg345_cleaned_100_lines.txt`.

Note: The shell commands `!head` and `!tail` are not available on all operating systems.
If they don't work for you, we can write similar functions in Python.
See the first exercise at the end of this chapter for suggestions.

"""### Ask a virtual assistant

In this chapter, we only scratched the surface of what regular expressions can do.
To get an idea of what's possible, ask a virtual assistant, "What are the most common special characters used in Python regular expressions?"

You can also ask for a pattern that matches particular kinds of strings.
For example, try asking:

* Write a Python regular expression that matches a 10-digit phone number with hyphens.

* Write a Python regular expression that matches a street address with a number and a street name, followed by `ST` or `AVE`.

* Write a Python regular expression that matches a full name with any common title like `Mr` or `Mrs` followed by any number of names beginning with capital letters, possibly with hyphens between some names.

And if you want to see something more complicated, try asking for a regular expression that matches any legal URL.

A regular expression often has the letter `r` before the quotation mark, which indicates that it is a "raw string".
For more information, ask a virtual assistant, "What is a raw string in Python?"

"""### Exercise

*The Count of Monte Cristo* is a novel by Alexandre Dumas that is considered a classic.
Nevertheless, in the introduction of an English translation of the book, the writer Umberto Eco confesses that he found the book to be "one of the most badly written novels of all time".

In particular, he says it is "shameless in its repetition of the same adjective," and mentions in particular the number of times "its characters either shudder or turn pale."

To see whether his objection is valid, let's count the number number of lines that contain the word `pale` in any form, including `pale`, `pales`, `paled`, and `paleness`, as well as the related word `pallor`.
Use a single regular expression that matches any of these words.
As an additional challenge, make sure that it doesn't match any other words, like `impale` -- you might want to ask a virtual assistant for help.

The following cell downloads the book from Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184>.

"""By this count, these words appear on `223` lines of the book, so Mr. Eco might have a point.

I found the notebook very helpful to go through as it explains the concepts very well. I fully interacted with the chapter and read through it. I still found the exersizes very challenging though, it also took me a very long time to do even though I skipped the parts that we didn't need to do. The notebook didn't have examples that were similar to the exercises that we had to do. I forgot to time it specifically but it might've taken me close to two hours. I'm very nervous for the test because these are the type of things where you can know how to do something but forget by the next day or make a very small error that will effect your whole thing. There are also so many things in this class and in other classes that have to be done so I don't know how I'll have time for it all! Hopefully it will all work out:)
Thank you!
